                <p>Inference techniques like forward and backward chaining play a crucial role in Artificial Intelligence, especially in expert systems. These methods allow AI to draw logical conclusions from a set of rules and facts, helping machines to think and make decisions like humans. Forward chaining uses available data to progress toward a conclusion, while backward chaining starts with a goal and works backward to verify if the known facts support it. Understanding these inference techniques helps us create smarter, rule-based systems capable of solving complex problems in various fields like diagnostics, decision-making, and problem-solving.</p>

            <div class="description-box">
                <p>Forward chaining is a reasoning technique used in rule-based systems and expert systems. It starts with a set of known facts and applies inference rules to derive new facts, progressing step by step towards a specific goal. This technique is data-driven, meaning it uses available information to explore all possible outcomes based on the rules provided. Forward chaining is particularly effective in environments where all facts are available, and the goal is to discover all possible conclusions.     <br>                     In a forward chaining system, each time a fact is established, it triggers relevant rules in the knowledge base. The process continues until no more new facts can be derived or until the desired goal is reached. This method is widely used in systems like automated planning, expert diagnostic systems, and decision-making tools.</p>

                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> We want to determine if an animal is a bird.</p>
                <p><strong>Rules and Facts:</strong></p>
                <ul class="rules">
                    <li><strong>Rule 1:</strong> IF the animal has feathers, THEN it is a bird.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule 2:</strong> IF the animal can fly, THEN it might be a bird.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule 3:</strong> IF the animal has feathers AND can fly, THEN it is confirmed to be a bird.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="steps-title">Step-by-Step Explanation</h4>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> We know the animal has feathers, so applying <strong>Rule 1</strong>, we infer it might be a bird.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The animal can fly, so <strong>Rule 2</strong> strengthens the possibility that it is a bird.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since both facts (feathers and flying) satisfy <strong>Rule 3</strong>, we conclude the animal is confirmed to be a bird.</p>

            <div class="description-box-alt">
                <p>Backward chaining is a goal-driven reasoning technique commonly employed in artificial intelligence and logic programming. This method starts with a specific goal or hypothesis and works backward to determine whether the known facts support that goal. In contrast to forward chaining, which moves from known facts to conclusions, backward chaining begins with the conclusion and searches for supporting evidence in the form of rules and facts.<br>The process involves checking if the goal can be proven true by identifying relevant rules that lead to it. If the necessary conditions outlined in the rules are met, the system can confirm the goal. If not, the system will further explore the prerequisites, repeating this process until either the goal is substantiated or it becomes clear that the goal cannot be reached. Backward chaining is particularly useful in diagnostic applications, such as troubleshooting, where the goal is to determine the cause of a problem based on known symptoms.</p>
